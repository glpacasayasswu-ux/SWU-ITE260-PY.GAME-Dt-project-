The Mystery Word Guess Game is an interactive word-guessing activity in which players attempt to identify a concealed word by entering individual letter guesses. Prior to the start of the game, players select a theme—such as Animals, Fruits, or Countries—and a difficulty level ranging from Easy to Hard. Based on these selections, the program randomly chooses a word from the corresponding category.

The chosen word remains hidden, and players must deduce it through incremental letter guesses. Correct guesses reveal the matching letters within the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts. The objective is to successfully determine the complete word before exhausting all available tries.
